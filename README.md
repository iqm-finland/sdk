# IQM SDK & Docs

This repository holds the mirror of the source code of IQM SDK: a collection of libraries for operating IQM's quantum computers.
It also builds and publishes documentation pages for those libraries: [https://docs.meetiqm.com/](https://docs.meetiqm.com/).
The versions in this mirror correspond to the latest stable release of IQM QCCSW (Quantum Computing Control Software).

This GitHub repository is a read-only mirror that isn't used for accepting contributions.
